#CRUD Database Application

##This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Next.js and React. The application interacts with a backend API to perform database operations for managing posts.

###Features

1.Create new posts with a title and body.

2.Read and display all posts from the backend.

3.Update existing posts.

4.Delete posts.

###Loading state handling while fetching data.

Technologies Used

Next.js (React framework)

React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

Tailwind CSS (for styling)

Fetch API (to interact with the backend API)

How It Works

Fetching Posts

When the component mounts, it fetches posts from the API using fetchPosts inside useEffect.

Creating a Post

Users enter a title and body.

The createPost function sends a POST request to the API.

The new post is added to the state.

Updating a Post

Clicking "Edit" sets the post to editingPost.

The user modifies the title or body.

The updatePost function sends a PUT request to update the post.

Deleting a Post

Clicking "Delete" sends a DELETE request to remove the post from the backend.

Possible Enhancements

Add authentication and user management.

Improve UI/UX with animations.

Implement error handling and validation.
